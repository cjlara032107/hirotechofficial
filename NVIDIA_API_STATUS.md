# 🔍 NVIDIA API Status Check

## ✅ Current Status

**NVIDIA API will work on Vercel (Production) ✅**

**NVIDIA API may NOT work locally ❌** (unless you add ENCRYPTION_KEY)

---

## 📊 Test Results

### ✅ What's Working:
- ✅ **1 active NVIDIA API key** found in database
- ✅ **Encryption key** is set in Vercel (production)
- ✅ **API key format** is correct (`nvapi-8B...`)

### ⚠️ What Needs Attention:

**Local Development:**
- ❌ `ENCRYPTION_KEY` not set in `.env.local`
- ⚠️ Database keys can't be decrypted locally (they were encrypted with Vercel's key)
- ✅ **Solution:** Add `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to `.env.local` (same as Vercel)

**OR** use environment variable fallback:
- Add `NVIDIA_API_KEY` to `.env.local` for local development

## 🚀 How NVIDIA API Works

### Priority Order:
1. **Database API Keys** (encrypted, managed through UI)
2. **Fallback:** `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable
3. **Fallback:** `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable

### Current Setup:
- ✅ Database has 1 active NVIDIA API key
- ✅ Key is encrypted and stored securely
- ✅ Will work on Vercel (ENCRYPTION_KEY is set)
- ⚠️ Won't work locally unless you add ENCRYPTION_KEY

---

## 🔧 To Make It Work Locally

### Option 1: Add ENCRYPTION_KEY (Recommended)

Add to `.env.local`:
```env
ENCRYPTION_KEY=f902ad293f5f9af42c98b007dfdc0eede8614ac2be7a985c23347e051f3bcf81
```

This allows you to decrypt database-stored keys locally.

### Option 2: Use Environment Variable (Alternative)

Add to `.env.local`:
```env
NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-your-actual-key-here
```

This bypasses the database and uses the environment variable directly.

## ✅ Production (Vercel) Status

**NVIDIA API is fully configured and will work on Vercel:**
- ✅ ENCRYPTION_KEY is set
- ✅ Database keys can be decrypted
- ✅ 1 active NVIDIA API key available
- ✅ All AI features will use NVIDIA API

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test on Production:
1. Go to: `https://hirotechofficial-beta.vercel.app`
2. Login as DEVELOPER
3. Sync a contact from Facebook
4. Check if AI Context analysis works
5. Look for `[NVIDIA]` logs in browser console

### Test Locally:
1. Add `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to `.env.local` (same as Vercel)
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Test AI features
4. Check console for `[NVIDIA]` logs

## 📋 Summary

| Environment | Status | Reason |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **Vercel (Production)** | ✅ **Will Work** | ENCRYPTION_KEY is set, database keys can be decrypted |
| **Local Development** | ⚠️ **May Not Work** | ENCRYPTION_KEY not set locally, can't decrypt database keys |

**Action Required for Local:**
- Add `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to `.env.local` OR
- Add `NVIDIA_API_KEY` to `.env.local`

**Production is ready! ✅**
